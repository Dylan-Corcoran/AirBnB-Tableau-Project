# AirBnB_Tableau_Project

The purpose of this project was to provide insights to an AirBnB host based upon data taken directly from Airbnb: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

1. After downloading the dataset, it was cleaned in Excel before work could begin on the visualisations. 
2. The data was then uploaded to Tableau, where several worksheets were created, all of which eventually fed into the dashboard. 
3. The final product can be viewed on my Tableau Public profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dylan.corcoran/viz/AirBnBProject_16546300026490/Dashboard1
